##---------- Image Ranking ----------
##
## Images are scored as follows:
##
## 1. Calculate 3 input scores for each image
##
##    pixel_score = [total image pixels] / [total screen pixels]
##
##    ratio_score = [image x-y ratio] / [screen x-y ratio]
##                                    or
##                  [screen x-y ratio] / [image x-y ratio]
##                             (whichever is <1)
##
##    views_score = [# views of this image] / [highest # views of all images]
##
## 2. Run each input score through a logistic function to get 3 logistic scores per image.
##    See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function
##
##                         1 -  -  -  -  -  -  ‚------
##                                            /
##       logistic score   .5 -  -  -  -  -  -/ <-- midpoint with slope k
##                                          /
##                         0 -  -  - ------‘
##
##                                     input score
##
##    Logistic functions are defined by their midpoint and slope (k).  Set the midpoint
##    to the threshold between a good and bad input score.
##    eg. if an image having 60% of the pixels of the screen is unacceptable
##        but 90% is acceptable, set pixel_midpoint to .75
##    Use k to control the slope or steepness at the midpoint to define a harder boundary
##    between good and bad input score.
##
## 3. Multiply logistic scores to get a final score for each image.
##
##    final_score = ratio_logistic_score * views_logistic_score * pixel_logistic_score

## images with a x-y ratio within 5% of the screen ratio will get a ratio score
## of .5 or higher
# ratio_midpoint = .95
# ratio_k = 15

## setting views_midpoint to .75 will give images whose number of views is in the 75th
## percentile a views score of .5, a higher views score for more views and vice versa
# views_midpoint = .75
# views_k = 2

## setting pixel_midpoint to 1 with large pixel_k will essentially
## filter out images with lower pixel count than the screen
# pixel_midpoint = 1
pixel_k = 100
