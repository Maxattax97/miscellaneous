# This file contains pin mappings for the stock 2020 Creality Ender 3 V2
# upgraded to be similar to the 2022 Creality Ender 3 V2 Neo. To use this
# config, during "make menuconfig" select the STM32F103 with a "28KiB
# bootloader" and serial (on USART1 PA10/PA9) communication. This will work for
# a USB serial configuration.

# If you prefer a direct serial connection, in "make menuconfig"
# select "Enable extra low-level configuration options" and select
# serial (on USART3 PB11/PB10), which is broken out on the 10 pin IDC
# cable used for the LCD module as follows:
# 3: Tx, 4: Rx, 9: GND, 10: VCC

# Flash this firmware by copying "out/klipper.bin" to a SD card and
# turning on the printer with the card inserted. The firmware
# filename must end in ".bin" and must not match the last filename
# that was flashed.

# This also works for the GD32F303 based Creality 4.2.2 board (which Max's
# printer uses)

# See docs/Config_Reference.md for a description of parameters.
